# Project-6-Convolutional-Neural-Network

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN, or ConvNet) is a special architecture of multi-layer artificial neural networks, that is commonly used for image classification. In this project, CNN is used as an image classifier for the CIFAR-10 dataset. CIFAR-10 dataset comprises of 60,000 low-resolution (32x32) colour images. It consists of 10 different classes with 6000 images in each class, which are airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks. These 10 classes can be classified to two classes, animals and modes of transport. Animal class includes bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, and horse. While transport includes airplane, automobile, ship and truck. Our goal is to develop a CNN that differentiates between images of animals and forms of transport.
